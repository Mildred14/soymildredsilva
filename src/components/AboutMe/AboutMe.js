          <p>
            Iâ€™m Mildred, a passionate Mexican web developer,
            a coffee lover, and a content creator. I started my
            journey when I decided to study Software engineering
            in 2015, but I fell in love with my career until
            2018 when I joined a BootCamp and knew the power
            of being a developer. Now, after 4 years working in
            different companies, I realize that a developer is not
            only a person who codes and delivers on time, it's also
            the engaged with the product and its quality. While it's
            common for developers to implement features without questioning the
            purpose, I take a different approach.  Before coding a feature
            or making a modification, I try to understand the reason behind
            that change. This helps me gain a deeper familiarity with the
            product and enables me to propose ideas and improvements that
            contribute to its overall success.
